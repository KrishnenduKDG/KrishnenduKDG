# Hi, I'm Krishnendu Dasgupta ðŸ‘‹

A **Backend Engineer** in a quest to be within the crowd (cz "standing out from crowd" needs exceptional skills which I lack ðŸ˜…).

My current quest is to change the title from "Enthusiast" to "Developer" when it comes to my **DevOps** skills. ðŸ”„ðŸ”„

Feel free to check out my projects or connect with me in my main Github Account [KrishnenduDG](https://github.com/KrishnenduDG)
