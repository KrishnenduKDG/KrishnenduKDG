# Hi, I'm Krishnendu Dasgupta 👋

A **Backend Engineer** in an attempt to be within the crowd (cz "standing out from crowd" needs exceptional skills which I lack 😅) and contribute to the tech space.

My current quest is to change the title from "Enthusiast" to "Professional" when it comes to my **DevOps** skills. 🔄🔄

Also, you may sometimes find me playing around with my not-so-exceptional Frontend skills trying to build some UIs which eventually breaks 😅

Feel free to check out my projects or connect with me on my main Github Account [KrishnenduDG](https://github.com/KrishnenduDG)
