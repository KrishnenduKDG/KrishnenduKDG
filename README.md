# Hi, I'm Krishnendu Dasgupta 👋

A **Backend Engineer** in an attempt to be within the crowd (cz "standing out from crowd" needs exceptional skills which I lack 😅) and contribute to the tech space.

My current quest is to change the title from "Enthusiast" to "Developer" when it comes to my **DevOps** skills. 🔄🔄
